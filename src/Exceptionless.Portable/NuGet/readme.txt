		How to get an api key
-------------------------------------
The Exceptionless client requires an api key to use the Exceptionless service. 
You can get your Exceptionless api key by logging into http://exceptionless.io 
and viewing your project configuration page.

-------------------------------------
		 Integration
-------------------------------------
NOTE: Please note that this library is a Portable Class Library (PCL). As such it is platform agnostic
and doesn't know how to read configuration settings or know what error handlers to wire up to. For 
these reasons if you are on a known platform then use the platform specific package to save you time 
configuring while giving you more contextual information. For more information please read the Exceptionless 
Portable Class Library (PCL) Configuration section on http://docs.exceptionless.io/contents/configuration/

You can set your api key by calling the following code on startup:

ExceptionlessClient.Default.Configuration.ApiKey = "API_KEY_HERE"

You can also configure the client via attributes. To configure the client using attributes please add 
the following assembly attribute and your own Exceptionless api key to your project (E.G., AssemblyInfo class).

[assembly: Exceptionless.Configuration.Exceptionless("API_KEY_HERE")]

Finally, you must call the following line of code to read your configuration from the attribute.

Exceptionless.ExceptionlessClient.Default.Configuration.ReadFromAttributes()

Please note that you will need to pass in the the assembly that contains the attributes if you place
place the above attribute outside of the  entry assembly or calling assembly.

Exceptionless.ExceptionlessClient.Default.Configuration.ReadFromAttributes(typeof(MyClass).Assembly)

Please visit the wiki https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.Net/wiki/Sending-Events
for examples on sending events to Exceptionless.

-------------------------------------
   Manually reporting an exception
-------------------------------------
By default the Exceptionless Client will report all unhandled exceptions. You can 
also manually send an exception by importing the Exceptionless namespace and calling 
the following method.
