  General Data Protection Regulation

By default the Exceptionless Client will report all available metadata including potential PII data.
You can fine tune the collection of information via Data Exclusions or turning off collection completely.

Please visit the wiki https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.Net/wiki/Configuration#general-data-protection-regulation
for detailed information on how to configure the client to meet your requirements.

You must import the "Exceptionless" namespace and call the following line
of code to start reporting log messages.

loggerFactory.AddExceptionless("API_KEY_HERE");

Alternatively, you can also use the different overloads of the AddExceptionless method
for different configuration options.
